                            production.h

   Fields in a production:

      name:  points to the name of the production (a symbol)

      documentation:  points to a string (a memory_block_for_string) giving
        user-provided documentation about the production, or NIL if the
        user didn't give any documentation for it.

      reference_count:  (see below)

      firing_count:  the number of times this production has ever fired
        since it was created.  (Note that this is not reset by an init-soar.)

      next, prev:  used for a doubly-linked list of productions of the same
        type (see below).  The list header is all_productions_of_type[].

      type: the type of the production:  USER_PRODUCTION_TYPE,
        DEFAULT_PRODUCTION_TYPE, CHUNK_PRODUCTION_TYPE, or
        JUSTIFICATION_PRODUCTION_TYPE.

      declared_support:  indicates whether the production was declared
        :o-support or :i-support.  This field is either UNDECLARED_SUPPORT,
        DECLARED_O_SUPPORT, or DECLARED_I_SUPPORT.

      trace_firings:  true iff a (pwatch) has been set on this production.

      p_node:  If the production is currently in the Rete, this points to
        the corresponding p_node in the Rete.  If the production is not in
        the Rete, this field is NIL.

      action_list:  singly-linked list of the RHS actions of the production.

      rhs_unbound_variables:  A (consed) list of variables used on the RHS
        that aren't bound on the LHS, in the order of their indices (for
        rhs_values).  For chunks, this is NIL, since we discard chunk
        variable names.

      instantiations:  header for a doubly-linked list of the instantiations
        of this production that are currently in the match set (i.e.,
        Rete-supported).

      OPERAND_which_assert_list: (need comment info from REW or RCHONG)

   Reference counts on productions:
      +1 if it's in production memory (i.e., hasn't been excised)
      +1 for each existing instantiation pointing to it
   We deallocate a production if its reference_count goes to 0.

                             Conditions

   Conditions are used for two things:  (1) to represent the LHS of newly
   entered productions (new SP's or chunks); and (2) to represent the
   instantiated LHS in production instantiations.

   Fields in a condition:

      type:  indicates the type of condition:  either POSITIVE_CONDITION,
        NEGATIVE_CONDITION, or CONJUNCTIVE_NEGATION_CONDITION.

      already_in_tc:  (reserved for use by the cond_is_in_tc() stuff in
        production.c)

      next, prev:  used for a doubly-linked list of all conditions on the
        LHS, or all subconditions of an NCC.

      data.tests.id_test, data.tests.attr_test, data.tests.value_test:
        for positive and negative conditions, these are the three wme
        field tests for the condition.

      test_for_acceptable_preference:  for positive and negative conditions,
        this is true iff the condition tests for acceptable preference wmes.

      data.ncc.top, data.ncc.bottom:  for NCC's, these point to the top and
        bottom of the subconditions likned list.

      bt:  for top-level positive conditions in production instantiations,
        this structure gives information for that will be used in backtracing.

      reorder:  (reserved for use by the reorderer)

                      Transitive Closure Utilities
               Marking, Unmarking, and Collecting Symbols

   Get_new_tc_number() is called from lots of places.  Any time we need
   to mark a set of identifiers and/or variables, we get a new tc_number
   by calling this routine, then proceed to mark various ids or vars
   by setting the sym->tc_num or sym->tc_num fields.

   Sometimes in addition to marking symbols using their tc_num fields,
   we also want to build up a list of the symbols we've marked.  So,
   the routines here take an "id_list" or "var_list" argument.  This
   argument should be NIL if no such list is desired.  If non-NIL, it
   should point to the header of the linked list being built.

       Transitive Closure Calculations for Conditions and Actions

   Usage:
     1. Set my_tc = get_new_tc_number() to start a new TC
     2. (optional) If you want linked lists of symbols in the TC, initialize
        id_list=NIL and var_list=NIL.
        If you're not using id_list and/or var_list, give NIL for "&id_list"
        and/or "&var_list" in the function calls below.
     3. (optional) setup any id's or var's that you want to include in the
        initial TC, by calling
           add_symbol_to_tc (sym, my_tc, &id_list, &var_list)
        (If not using id_list or var_list, you can just mark
         sym->{id,var}.tc_num = my_tc instead.)
     4. To do the work you want, use any of the following any number of times:
            add_cond_to_tc (cond, my_tc, &id_list, &var_list);
            add_action_to_tc (cond, my_tc, &id_list, &var_list);
            result = cond_is_in_tc (cond, my_tc);
            result = action_is_in_tc (action, my_tc);
     5. When finished, free the cons cells in id_list and var_list (but
        don't call symbol_remove_ref() on the symbols in them).

  Warning:  actions must not contain reteloc's or rhs unbound variables here.

                         Variable Generator

   These routines are used for generating new variables.  The variables
   aren't necessarily "completely" new--they might occur in some existing
   production.  But we usually need to make sure the new variables don't
   overlap with those already used in a *certain* production--for instance,
   when variablizing a chunk, we don't want to introduce a new variable that
   conincides with the name of a variable already in an NCC in the chunk.

   To use these routines, first call reset_variable_generator(), giving
   it lists of conditions and actions whose variables should not be
   used.  Then call generate_new_variable() any number of times; each
   time, you give it a string to use as the prefix for the new variable's
   name.  The prefix string should not include the opening "<".
-------------------------------------------------------------------- */

									  condition *conds_with_vars_to_avoid,

/* -------------------------------------------------------------------
                         Production Management

    For each type of production, we maintain a doubly-linked list of
    all productions of that type.  The headers of these dll's are
    stored in the array all_productions_of_type[].  Another array,
    num_productions_of_type[], keeps counts of how many productions
    there are of each type.

    Production_add_ref() and production_remove_ref() are macros for
    incrementing and decrementing the reference count on a production.
    Production_remove_ref() also deallocates the production if the
    count goes to 0.

    Make_production() does reordering, compile-time o-support calc's,
    and builds and returns a production structure for a new production.
    It does not enter the production into the Rete net, however.
    The "type" argument should be one of USER_PRODUCTION_TYPE, etc.
    The flag "reorder_nccs" tells whether to recursively reorder
    the subconditions of NCC's--this is not necessary for newly
    built chunks, as their NCC's are copies of other NCC's in SP's that
    have already been reordered.  If any error occurs, make_production()
    returns NIL.

    Deallocate_production() and excise_production() do just what they
    say.  Normally deallocate_production() should be invoked only via
    the production_remove_ref() macro.
