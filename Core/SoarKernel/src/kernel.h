/* --------------- Explanation of directives that alter Soar behavior ----------------
 *
 *  - MEMORY_POOL_STATS: Keep statistics on memory pool usage
 *
 *  - NO_TIMING_STUFF: Eliminates all timing statistics. The "stats" command
 *                     will have much shorter output.
 *
 *  - DETAILED_TIMING_STATS: Keep statistics on how much time is spent in
 *                           various parts of the system.
 *      Note: If you have DETAILED_TIMING_STATS defined, you must NOT define
 *            NO_TIMING_STUFF
 *
 *  - DO_TOP_LEVEL_REF_CTS: Maintain refcounts on wmes/prefs at the top level.
 *    Note: This can result in larger memory growth due to top-level objects
 *    that never get deallocated because the ref counts never drop to 0.
 *    The default for Soar v6 - v8.6.1 was to maintain the ref cts.  It's
 *    possible that in your particular application, weird things could happen
 *    if you don't do these ref cts, but if you are trying to improve performance
 *    and reduce memory, it's worth testing your system with the
 *    top-level-ref-cts turned off. Soar will be much more efficient.
 *    See comments in recmem.cpp
 *
 *  - BUG_139_WORKAROUND: Enable workaround for bug 139
 *  - BUG_139_WORKAROUND_WARNING: Print a warning whenever we are ignoring a
 *    situation when there's no instance to retract for a justification
 *
 *  - O_REJECTS_FIRST: Enable Soar to deal with certain productions in a more
 *    intuitive manner.  In particular, productions that modify a wme value by
 *    reject its current value and asserting its new value need to ensure that
 *    the current and new values differ.  This option may add a small run time
 *    cost, since two loops are made through the preferences list.
 *
 *  - DISCARD_CHUNK_VARNAMES: Set to false to preserve variable names in chunks
 *    within the rete.  This takes extra memory.
 *
 *  - TOKEN_SHARING_STATS: Get statistics on token counts in rete with and
 *    without sharing.
 *
 *  - TOKEN_SHARING_STATS: Gather statistics on null activations in the rete.
 *
 *  - SHARING_FACTORS:Gather statistics on beta node sharing in the rete.
 *
